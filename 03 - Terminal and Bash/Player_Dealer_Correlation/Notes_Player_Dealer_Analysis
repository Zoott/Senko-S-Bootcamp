After searching through the logs I have found the player and the dealer who were present and together at the same table whenever a big loss was noted.

At the exact times when the losses were documented for all 3 days, the dealer working at the roulette table was Billy Jones and the player was Mylie Schmidt.

This leads me to believe that these two are working together and are responsible for the huge losses.
