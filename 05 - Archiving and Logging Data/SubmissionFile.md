### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:
tar xvvf TarDocs.tar
2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:
tar cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude='TarDocs/Documents/Java' TarDocs/Documents/
3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
tar tvvf Javaless_docs.tar | less
**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?
Because -x extracts the archive and -c creates the archive, impossible to use them together (it depends :P).

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
0 6 * * 3 sudo tar cvvfz ./auth_backup.gz /var/log/auth.log

---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
mkdir -p backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}
##### I didn't have the backups directory created so I added that to the command as well with the -p flag. #####
2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

   #!/bin/bash

free >> ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

du -h >> ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

lsof /dev/null >> ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt

df -h | awk -F' ' '{print $1,$4}' >> ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt


3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
chmod u+x system.sh
**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
./system.sh
**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
    /var/log/auth.log{
     missingok
     rotate 7
     weekly
     notifempty
     delaycompress
     
    }
    ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:
systemctl status auditd
2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:
    sudo vim /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    max_log_file = 35
    num_logs = 7
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:
systemctl restart auditd
5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:
sudo auditctl -l
6. Command to produce an audit report:
sudo aureport -au
7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:
sudo useradd attacker | sudo aureport -m
8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:
sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron
9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:
sudo cat /etc/audit/audit.rules
---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:
journalctl -p 0..3
1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:
journalctl --disk-usage -b -0
1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:
journalctl --vacuum-files--2

1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:
journalctl -p 0..2 >> ~/Priority_High.txt
1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    0 6 * * * journalctl -p 0..2 >> ~/Priority_High.txt
    ```
